Use these steps if you want to install MongoDB Compass on OpenSUSE but don't see that distribution listed:

1. Add the Databases repository (may or may not be required?... - I did.) SUSE does not have this out of the box since not everyone uses it:

sudo zypper up
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:database/#YOUR_VERSION#/server:database.repo
sudo zypper refresh

2. Add gnome-keyring dependency (may be listed as optional - in fact, it is required):

sudo zypper in gnome-keyring lsb-core-noarch gconf2

3. Download the .rpm (cloud.mongodb.com) and install:

sudo rpm -ivh --nodeps mongodb-compass-1.21.2.x86_64.rpm

*The --nodeps option is needed I guess because of the dependency name mismatch between Redhat (GConf2) and SUSE (gconf2) - Thanks to the peeps on this thread for figuring that out => https://www.reddit.com/r/mongodb/comments/e873bk/no_mongodb_compass_for_opensuse/

4. Start it up:

mongdb-compass
